However, there is more to engineering than just being very technical and skilled in the art. Atharva possesses drive, determination, passion, attention to detail, inquisitiveness, and intuition that take his engineering abilities much further than your average engineer.  \nAdditionally, Atharva works really well with people and in a team setting. He managed vendors and worked with collaborative systems with finesse. \nI'd also just say that on a personal level, Atharva is one of the more fun, honest, and sincere people I've had the pleasure of working with.\nI have no doubts, whatever Atharva chooses to do in life, he's going to do really well with it.
