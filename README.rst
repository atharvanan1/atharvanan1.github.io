Hello there new students.
=========================

This will be mostly 5-6 minutes read, and a highly personal opinion.

We have really good courses in CU Boulder, and this isn't a promotion of CU. Look at this rather profession of love towards the coursework itself. Personally, I value learning by understanding the causal connections to what I fundamentally know. What I fundamentally know is **ELECTRONS WORK, MAKING THEM FLOW GENERATES A CURRENT**. It's the easiest thing for me to get back to. Trust me, even after all these years being a suck-ass EE, I always roll back to Electrons. So, if someone says, "I am gonna change the register value to 0 from 1.", it should scale back to me in a view that tells me how electrons work. This is time consuming, and real world is not about **understanding** things perfectly. Real world is about making things work. So, if you like to make things work, you skip this. If you like to understanding things deeply, read more.

Here we go!

Embedded System Design
======================

This course has amazing coursework and professor. Do this if you want to gain **appreciation** for Embedded Systems as whole. (P.S. Linden McClure is the best XD)

You might say, "Oh he is teaching 8051, that's old shit". Let it be old, it's a perfect system to get a top-down view from. This helps you understand and appreciate Embedded Systems. This can become a really huge motivating factor in your further studies of Embedded Systems.

Professor takes you to the bottom of it. He wants you to probe every electrical signal coming out of the silicon chip. He wants you to understand how the time taken by signal to propagate through different chips is important. He wants you to understand that "let's just make this work somehow" can be a huge pain in the arse. You actually work with hardware that is barebone of every Embedded System out there. Address lines, data lines, read and write signals, etc. One good aspect is that, as you develop your code for 8051 and do some hardware wiring in part 1, in part 2 you do almost same functionality on ARM M4. This helped me gain respect for Embedded Systems and how far it has come. It feels so much convenient to use ARM M4, but it is also easy to relate to because we have done the same stuff in 8051 in a naked way.

I personally feel romantically connected to this course.

Principles of Embedded Software
===============================

This course is valuable. However, I didn't like how my professor approached it. He is a great man, but he should have been more strict and kicked people for writing shitty code. I think the professor is going to change (Dan who teaches AESD is restructuring the course or so I hear, Dan is great). If you forget your grades, and actually try to learn how to write code in this class, you are bound for success. How do you use the variables, how do you structure your code, how do you abstract the driver functionality away, how can you design a state machine, how do you write code using interrupts. These are the common things you will learn here. If you fail to learn these, you are doomed (is what I say. No you aren't doomed, you will have a difficult time). Writing code is an art, and it's learnable. You are designing systems, you are not **just** making them work for some stupid grades in a foreign university you are going to pay 4.5k for. (sorry for being harsh :P)

There is so much to take away from here. Think about how you would make the system, then think about how you would write the code in a good **looking** way - that's something I would take from it. (your mileage may vary)

I forgot to mention Makefiles and Test Driven Development is also included in this course.

Advanced Embedded Software Development
======================================

This course wants you to make out with Linux. (Pardon me for my language XD)

Dan Walkes teaches this, I like him. He is admirable. That also means he expects a lot from students. Do the right things, and he will help you. He will help you either way.

I enjoyed this course, because I love fondling with Linux. This course helps you understand how to build applications for Linux. Why? Because that's what you will be deploying on your Embedded System which you are shipping with Embedded Linux. Then it teaches you how to build custom Embedded Linux System (not Distros, yet). Why? Because that's what you will be loading on your Embedded System. Then it teaches you how to write kernel driver modules. Why? Because that's what you will need to support that I2C Temperature Sensor you put.

The course gives you great understanding of how Linux is structured. There are two build systems - Buildroot and Yocto, they are both really amazing. I am not much interested in Buildroot as it's simple, Yocto seems really alluring. When you take this course, explore Yocto. All of these things are **used** in the Industry. So be the best in them.

Internet of Things Embedded Firmware
====================================

Make Fitbit here. Professors have been shuffling, and original course creator doesn't teach it anymore - which is a bummer. However, you can study on your own. DO NOT FEEL DISCOURAGED, there is much more to learn in this course.

Writing low power firmware - that's something you should take away from the course. 
BLUETOOOOOTHH - this is what I loved personally. You go through how Bluetooth is made, and you fall in love with it. Read it all! Read all the stuff in this course - you won't have time, you will lose marks. Read it all! Once I read the Bluetooth Book, it made me appreciate how much efforts went into structuring the Bluetooth LE. They have though about how to reduce cost, how to increase the reliability, how to ensure low power operations, how to provide a flexible interface that is compatible with older Bluetooth version. DAMN! It's all FUN. If you don't read it all, if you don't try to understand the efforts taken by the Engineers, you will miss on the experience. (is what I feel, so go ahead and fall in love with Bluetooth - and also fall in love with other Wireless protocols and read about them, use them)

PCB Design and Manufacturer
===========================

Everyone says this is a light course. Cool, it is. Everyone says you get good grades here. Cool, you do get good grades here. However, this is the best course that's available in CU (according to me). Why? Professor is really really amazing. He is the God of Signal Integrity. He helps you understand how there are certain myths in making PCBs. but....that's stupid? Okay, he has something more.

He helps you have a model of Electrical Engineering which will help you in Industry. He helps you understand how tiny things matter, and how silly optimizations (sometimes) doesn't nothing to help. All of this with hands-on labs (donno how it will work out with COVID stuff). Read his textbook, do the assignments, labs, and readings dilligently. There is soooo sooo soo much more to learn in this course. It's more than having this course printed on your resume. Professor is really humble, and he **takes** you on a journey, even if you ask "do I put a decoupling capacitor here? What value? Why?". That's the thing I appreciate. If learn dilligently, you will be **enlightened** XD.

That's all I have to say.
